### What is this

HyperCPU is a set of programs created to work with my own simple ISA (instruction set architecture). The project was created for fun, but it took a lot of time (and nerves), and I learned a lot while working on it.

HyperCPU project includes:
* **hCPU emulator** (aka `hcemul`);
* **hASM assembler** (aka `hcasm`);
* ~~**hASM disassembler**~~ (planned).

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for project ideas and tasks.

### Installation

>[!WARNING]
> HyperCPU supports 64-bit GNU/Linux systems only. It is known to be successfully built and running on `amd64` and `aarch64` architectures.
>
> HyperCPU fails to build and/or work properly under \*BSD systems ­— please do not ask us for support of these systems. Windows support is also not planned.

#### Binaries

Pre-compiled binaries are currently not available. Sorry.

#### Building from sources

Building HyperCPU requires these dependencies to be installed:

* **C++20 compilers:** GCC 12+, Clang 14+.
* **Build systems:** CMake 3.25+, Ninja, GNU make.
* **Libraries:** re2, fmt (development files, of course).

Building the tests requires googletest (gtest) to be installed. Generating the documentation in HTML format requires Python 3 and a few modules (`python3-pip`, `python3-sphinx`, `python3-sphinx-rtd-theme`) to be installed.

After installing dependencies run these commands in the terminal:

```bash
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/HyperCPU-Project/HyperCPU
$ cd HyperCPU
$ cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make -C build default -j$(nproc)
```

The build process can be customized using various build options (`cmake ... -DBUILD_OPTION=VALUE ...`):

* `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING` — project build profile (`Release`, `RelWithDebInfo` or `Debug`). Mandatory to be specified.
* `HCPU_COMPILER:STRING` allows to select a compiler that will be used to build the project. Supported values:
    * `auto` (default) — let CMake automatically detect a needed compiler or use compiler paths defined by user.
    * `clang` — use Clang, search for `clang` and `clang++` binaries. Hinting is supported, so if your `clang` binary is called `clang-19`, you can pass: `-DHCPU_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-19 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++-19`.
    * `gcc` — use GCC, search for `gcc` and `g++` binaries. Be careful: in some environments Clang can do `gcc --> clang` symlinks. You can hint the binary name the same way as with `clang` mode: `-DHCPU_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc-14 -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-14`.
* `HCPU_LTO:BOOL` — enable building with LTO. If Clang is used, CMake will search for LLD. If LLD is found, LTO will be enabled, otherwise not. If using GCC, there are no dependencies.
* `HCPU_MARCH_NATIVE:BOOL` — use native architecture (`-march=native`).
* `HCPU_SANITIZERS:BOOL` — use ASan and LSan sanitizers. Enabled by default — set to `OFF` to disable.

The compiled binaries should be located in `build` directory, and the generated documentation should be located in `docs/_build/html` directory. After building the project open `index.html` file and start reading the documentation.

Check out [examples](examples) folder for interesting code examples that will help you better understand the syntax of hASM and the power of HyperCPU.

### Usage

#### `hcasm` (hASM assembler)

```bash
$ ./hcasm [-h] [--help] [--version] [-o VAR] [-c] [-V VAR] source
```

* `source` — source code file to be compiled.
* `-h`, `--help` — display help message and exit.
* `--version` — display program version and exit.
* `-o VAR` — specify output binary file name.
* `-c` — generate an object file.
* `-V VAR` — specify verbosity level (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`). Default value is `warning`.

#### `hcemul` (hCPU emulator)

```bash
$ ./hcemul [-h] [--help] [--version] [-v VAR] [-m VAR] [--memory VAR] binary
```

* `binary` — binary file to be executed.
* `-h`, `--help` — display help message and exit.
* `--version` — display program version and exit.
* `-v VAR` — specify verbosity level (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`). Default value is `warning`.
* `-m`, `--memory` — specify max. memory amount to be used. Postfixes are supported. Default value is `8K`.

### What is this

HyperCPU is a set of programs created to work with my own simple ISA (instruction set architecture). The project was created for fun, but it took a lot of time (and nerves), and I learned a lot while working on it.

HyperCPU project includes:
* **hCPU emulator** (aka `hcemul`);
* **hASM assembler** (aka `hcasm`);
* ~~**hASM disassembler**~~ (planned).

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for project ideas and tasks.

### Installation

>[!WARNING]
> HyperCPU supports 64-bit GNU/Linux systems only. It is known to be successfully built and running on `amd64` and `aarch64` architectures.
>
> HyperCPU fails to build and/or work properly under \*BSD systems ­— please do not ask us for support of these systems. Windows support is also not planned.

#### Binaries

Pre-compiled binaries are currently not available. Sorry.

#### Building from sources

Building HyperCPU requires these dependencies to be installed:

* **C++20 compilers:** GCC 12+, Clang 14+.
* **Build system:** Bazel.

Generating the documentation in HTML format requires Python 3 and a few modules (`python3-sphinx`, `python3-sphinx-rtd-theme`) to be installed.

After installing dependencies run these commands in the terminal:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/HyperCPU-Project/HyperCPU
cd HyperCPU
bazel build //src/... --config=linux-opt
cd docs
make html
```

The compiled binaries should be located in `bazel-out` directory, and the generated documentation should be located in `docs/_build/html` directory. After building the project open `index.html` file and start reading the documentation.

To run the resulting binaries without searching for them in `bazel-out`, use `bazel run`.
```
bazel run //src/Assembler:hcasm -- <args>
bazel run //src/Emulator:hcemul -- <args>
```

Check out [examples](examples) folder for interesting code examples that will help you better understand the syntax of hASM and the power of HyperCPU.

### Usage

#### `hcasm` (hASM assembler)

```bash
$ ./hcasm [-h] [--help] [--version] [-o VAR] [-c] [-V VAR] source
```

* `source` — source code file to be compiled.
* `-h`, `--help` — display help message and exit.
* `--version` — display program version and exit.
* `-o VAR` — specify output binary file name.
* `-c` — generate an object file.
* `-V VAR` — specify verbosity level (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`). Default value is `warning`.

#### `hcemul` (hCPU emulator)

```bash
$ ./hcemul [-h] [--help] [--version] [-v VAR] [-m VAR] [--memory VAR] binary
```

* `binary` — binary file to be executed.
* `-h`, `--help` — display help message and exit.
* `--version` — display program version and exit.
* `-v VAR` — specify verbosity level (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`). Default value is `warning`.
* `-m`, `--memory` — specify max. memory amount to be used. Postfixes are supported. Default value is `8K`.
